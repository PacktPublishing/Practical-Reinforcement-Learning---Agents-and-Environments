# Practical Reinforcement Learning - Agents and Environments [Video]
This is the code repository for [Practical Reinforcement Learning - Agents and Environments [Video]](https://www.packtpub.com/big-data-and-business-intelligence/practical-reinforcement-learning-agents-and-environments-video?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781787129344), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the video course from start to finish.
## About the Video Course
Reinforcement Learning (RL) has become one of the hottest research areas in ML and AI, and is expected to have widespread usage in diverse areas such as neuroscience, psychology, and more.

You can make an intelligent agent in a few steps: have it semi-randomly explore different choices of movement to actions given different conditions and states, then keep track of the reward or penalty associated with each choice for a given state or action.

In this course, you’ll learn how to code the core algorithms in RL and get to know the algorithms in both R and Python. This video course will help you hit the ground running, with R and Python code for Value Iteration, Policy Gradients, Q-Learning, Temporal Difference Learning, the Markov Decision Process, and Bellman Equations, which provides a framework for modeling decision making where outcomes are partly random and partly under the control of a decision maker.

At the end of the video course, you’ll know the main concepts and key algorithms in RL.
